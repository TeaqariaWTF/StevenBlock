## 📝 Changelog Note

- You can go to the "releases" section to see the latest changes.

- Typically, updates involve updating the hosts file, which helps block malicious software and ads that are currently active. This is important.

- Please also check, just in case, that the hosts file is up-to-date using any hosts manager or file manager. If it's not, please notify me.
